              Welcome to APMULTI demo 01 - basic
         (resting state processing with afni_proc.py)

This demonstrates processing multi-echo resting state data using afni_proc.py,
starting from a BIDS input tree (for naming, BIDS is not required), through
preprocessing and linear regression (projecting out unwanted signals).


To run a simple afni_proc.py analysis, it would be enough to:

   cd APMULTI_Demo1_rest

   cd scripts_desktop
   tcsh run_22_ap_me_b.tcsh

There are scripts for desktop usage and for biowulf usage.

   Please see README_contents.txt for details on the directory contents.
   Please see README_process.txt for details on processing the data.
